# Amazon Web Services Config File used by AWS CLI, SDKs, and tools
# This file was created by the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains plugin.
#
# Your AWS credentials are represented by access keys associated with IAM users.
# For information about how to create and manage AWS access keys for a user, see:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html
#
# This config file can store multiple access keys by placing each one in a
# named "profile". For information about how to change the access keys in a
# profile or to add a new profile with a different access key, see:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-config-files.html
#
# If both a credential and config file exists, the values in the credential file
# take precedence
